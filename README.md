# DragonDays

Welcome to the Dragon Days GitHub!

Not much here currently, but this will soon be a Unity repository.  The .gitignore follows the Unity template.

Right now, there's just the introductory brochure and a pair of concept maps for locations.  

The maps aren't meant to look pretty, just meant to convey basic information if you want a visual representation!
